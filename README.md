## About This Template

This template builds upon the original Gemini beamerposter theme and adds:

- Custom color themes (e.g., `vu`) and styling suited for Cambridge/VU branding
- Integration of logos and figure folders as per typical academic poster needs
- A Makefile and `.latexmkrc` for streamlined compilation with LuaLaTeX
- Example preamble and structure tailored for mathematical content and large-format posters

---

## Dependencies

To compile the poster successfully, you will need:

- A TeX distribution with [LuaTeX] support (e.g., TeX Live, MikTeX)
- `latexmk` if you want to use the included Makefile for easy building
- Required LaTeX packages, especially [beamerposter], which usually come pre-installed or can be fetched via [CTAN]
- The fonts [Raleway] and [Lato] installed or available to your TeX system (both are Open Font License)

---

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Edit `poster.tex` to customize:
    - Paper size, column layout, and scaling
    - Title, authors, and footer content
    - Included logos (in the `logos` folder)
    - Figures (in the `figures` folder)
    - Color theme by modifying or replacing `beamercolorthemevu.sty` and updating the `\usecolortheme` command

3. Compile your poster by running:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This runs `latexmk` with LuaLaTeX and builds `poster.pdf`.

4. To clean auxiliary files, run:
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

## Included Themes

This template currently provides:

- `vu` (custom theme based on Gemini for VU/University branding)

The original Gemini repository includes several themes:

- `gemini` (default)
- `mit`
- `labsix`

You can use those as inspiration or create your own by modifying the color theme `.sty` files.

## Design Goals

- **Minimal and clean:** Emphasis on clear and readable content  
- **Ready-to-use:** Includes everything needed to build posters out of the box  
- **Customizable:** Easy to tweak color themes and layouts for your institution or style
